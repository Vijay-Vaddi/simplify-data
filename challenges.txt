1. 1st attempt at saving in CSV had issues of managing table data relationship
	- so decided to use django's ORM and sqlite db
2. Date time value issues, 
	Time zone issues, offset aware/offset naive 
	used DateTimeField and timezone instead

3. when trying to save countries from teams, country name with hyphens are saving as duplicates
    added name = country_item['name'].replace('-', ' ').title() to avoid duplicates 
	and some data came with null values in ids, 

4. Non String type values returned, using utf-8 solved this. 
5. countries unique contraints failed even though searched by countryname, for eg "England"
	so searched only with names first and then proceed if found or create
6. Null values in venue id is not letting save data as django doesnt let null in primary key, 
	either allow null = true in models or skip team/venue items with null id in venue 
	skipped linking team to venue if venue is null. 

7. Team name unique constraint failed. 
	wrong usage of update_or_create/get_or_create, 
	pass only one item and then pass remaining values as defaults, 
	pop relationship items   
	also team ID is unique as per docs so removed unique name option

8. GET ALL PLAYERS, GET ALL COUNTRIES AND GET ALL TEAMS 
	first call to get all countries 
	use countries in table countries to get all teams/venue
	use team.id in all teams to fetch all players
	some team_ids out of range.
	Too many calls to API this way. 

9. Truncation and appending
	UNSURE of the best approach weather to use task scheduler or something simple. 
	used endpoint_tracker to check when the last enpoint was called 
	if last call was > 1 day 
		then objects.all.delete for clearing table and refetch for Teams, players, countries, Seasons
		adding new data to Fixtures with no distint append operation as django table gets updated by default
