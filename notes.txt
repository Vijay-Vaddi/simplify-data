1. saving countries to sql table using Country model. 
2. on each request, the countries are being appended with same values 
    -- so adding a 'last requested date_time' variables to keep track
    -- and only update if the time is 24hr+
3. saved teams informaition
5. Save players data for now while ignoring stats. 
    
    player statistics team_id - list containing list of players with birth and list their statistics( list of items) of that team 
    player statistics by league - list of players with birth, and list of their statistics (1 item) of that league     
    == both can be combined into one view. 
    
    -- player statistics by fixture, list of two teams containting list of players and their stats
        -- two teams, all players, all of their stats of that single game. 
        -- some changes to the ones above in the response, 
        -- considering to save player stats as whole json in db. for that league, or team  
    --- stats has probably been saved per game and calculated during response. 
        -- will ignore stats part for now. 

6.Fixtures: 
    goals {} total seems to be calculated so will ignore storing. 
    creating tables for scores, fixture, goals, status 
    team winner seem to be calculated so will ignore it while saving

    venue : 
        some venue ids are null, so have to modify venue class's venue_id

7. For regular checks added async call from front end using js to index() 
    --- and called other endpoints from inside index     









FINAL endpoints: GET All the players, Teams, Countries and Seasons of current day. 
                 GET all of previous days fixtures and append.
