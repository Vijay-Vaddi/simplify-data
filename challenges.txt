Date time value issues, 
Time zone issues, offset aware/offset naive 
-- used DateTimeField and timezone instead

when trying to save countries from teams, country name with hyphens are saving as duplicates

other issues 
	Antigua And Barbuda
	Antigua and Barbuda

    Bosnia
	Bosnia Herzegovina
	Bosnia and Herzegovina

    added name = country_item['name'].replace('-', ' ').title()
	logic to avoid duplicates 


Non String type values returned, 
countries unique contraints failed even though searched by countryname, for eg "England"
Null values in venue id is not letting save data as django doesnt let that, 
	either allow null = true in models or skip team/venue items with null id in venue 
	skipped linked team to venue if venue is null. 

-------
Team name unique constraint failed. 
=====
	team ID is unique as per docs so removed unique name option
